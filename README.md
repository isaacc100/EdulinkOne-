# EdulinkOne-
Very simple application i made to make opening Edulink One more efficent when using microsoft to log in.
(It also has the logo setup and an installer ect to make it look a bit better.)
It has 2 apps one that is a gui to edit the url and another that opens the url set.
Use the "Working,,," URL from loging into edulinkone as the url and it will log into edulink for you.
Basically its just an internet shortcut but you can pin it to taskbar and open from the start menu.
